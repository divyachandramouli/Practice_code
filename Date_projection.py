Date Projection
Complete the which_date() function below which returns the day that follows a specified time period after an initial date. Time periods can be specified in two different ways: as a number of days like "1 day" or "30 days", or as a number of weeks like "2 weeks" or "12 weeks".

HINT: Python's datetime module will be very useful for solving this problem! documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html

NOTE: This quiz will be evaluated in Python 2.
