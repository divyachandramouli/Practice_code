Lesson 4
========================================================
After plotting histograms of people's guesses of perceived audience size, Moira wanted to see how it matched up with the actual audience size - turned to scatterplots


***

### Scatterplots and Perceived Audience Size
Usually scatterplot is the best to examine the relationship between 2 continuous variables

We see horizontal stripes at 50, 100, 200, etc. (y axis is perceived audience size - seems like a lot of people guessed the same numbers)
Points are big clusters at the bottom - people are guessing small numbers - in reality their size is 100, 200
***
```{r}
getwd()
```
LOAD DATA

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep='\t')
names(pf)
```


### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}
qplot(x=age, y=friend_count, data=pf)
```

***
The equivalent ggplot syntax for the scatterplot:

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_point()
```

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:
Younger users have a lot of friends - as you go right cluster reduces youngers users have 1000s of more friends than users over 30

Vertical bars - people of higher ages - even 100, could be lies or fake accounts of teenagers given the high friend counts

***
## Get an idea of age statistics

```{r}
summary(pf$age)
```
13 - 113 years is the range ; younger than 13 not permitted on facebook

### ggplot Syntax

Use an xlim layer to ggplot - exclude users above 90 - those ages could be fake data / lies

```{r ggplot Syntax}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count), data=pf) + geom_point() + xlim(13,90)
```

***

### Overplotting
The area of the graph - bottom where points are stacked over each other - difficult to say how many points are in each region - overplotting
Set transparency of geom using alpha

```{r Overplotting}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count), data=pf) + geom_point(alpha = 1/20) + xlim(13,90)
# Takes 20 points to be the equivalent of one black dot
```
Bulk of data is below 1000 threshold for friend count 
Swap out geom_point with jitter
Age is continuous but we only have integer value - perfectly lined up columns of age - intuitively wrong - add some noise to each age to see the relationship more clearly
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count), data=pf) + geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20) + xlim(13,90)
# Takes 20 points to be the equivalent of one black dot
```
A more dispersed distribution

#### What do you notice in the plot?

The yound user friend counts are nearly as high as before
Bulk of young users have friend count below 1000
alpha is 1/20 - so it takes 20 points for a circle to appear completely dark
peak around 69 - faint - comparable to users in 25 or 26 age group
***

### Coord_trans()
### Transform the y axis using sqrt for a better visualization of the data - add a coord_trans layer to the geom_point plot

```{r Coord_trans()}
?coord_trans
```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count), data=pf) + geom_point(alpha = 1/20) + xlim(13,90) + coord_trans(y='sqrt')
```
We can see thresholds of friend count above which there are very few users 

We switched from jitter to point because if we want jitter we need to be careful and specify that the noise is for age and not friend count. Also, some users have a friend count of zero - adding noise to zero - we might end up with negative friend counts and those sqrt would be imaginary 

Add position_jitter and set a min height of 0 - advanced in terms of syntax - prevents from negative friend counts
Remember that jitter can add positive or negative noise to each point
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count), data=pf) + geom_point(alpha = 1/20, position=position_jitter(h=0)) + xlim(13,90) + coord_trans(y='sqrt')
```
Adds jitter
prevents from negative friend counts
Remember that jitter can add positive or negative noise to each point

### Alpha and Jitter

# Explore the relationship between friends initiated and age 

```{r Alpha and Jitter}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=friendships_initiated),data=pf)+geom_point()+xlim(13,90)
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=friendships_initiated),data=pf)+geom_point(alpha=1/10)+xlim(13,90)

```

Because of the discreteness in age, we jitter our points setting alpha as 10 points for one dark circle
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=friendships_initiated),data=pf)+geom_jitter(alpha=1/10)+xlim(13,90)
```
Another way to produce the above plot with 'position'

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=friendships_initiated),data=pf)+geom_point(alpha=1/10,position=position_jitter(h=0))+xlim(13,90) 
```
Since some friendships_initiated have very high values, let's take the coord_transformation (sqrt)

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=friendships_initiated),data=pf)+geom_point(alpha=1/10,position=position_jitter(h=0))+xlim(13,90) + coord_trans(y='sqrt')
```

### Overplotting and Domain Knowledge
Makes more sense to think about audience size as a percentage of their friends - helps to reduce overplotting a bit

Perceived audeince (% friends) - y axis
Actual audience (%friends ) - x axis

Some people have 50  friends while some have 1000 - so percentage makes more sense
