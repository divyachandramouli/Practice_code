Lesson 3
========================================================

***
### Pseudo-Facebook User Data
READING DATA:

You could also use the following code to load the Pseudo Facebook data. 
read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv') 

The read.delim() function defaults to the tab character as the separator between values and the period as the decimal character. Run ?read.csv or ?read.delim in the console for more details.

```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep='\t')

```

The file has 99000 rows/obs (users) and 15 variables 

***

DISPLAY THE VARIABLES
Goal is to understand user behavior and demographics - what they do on FB and what they use

```{r Pseudo-Facebook User Data}
names(pf)
```

***

### Histogram of Users' Birthdays - DOB by day - no. of users with birthdays on a certain day


```{r Histogram of Users\' Birthdays}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
names(pf)
qplot(x=dob_day,data=pf) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:31)

install.packages('ggthemes', dependencies = TRUE)
library(ggthemes)


  

```
```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal(14))
ggplot(aes(x = dob_day), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:31)
```

***

#### What are some things that you notice about this histogram?
Response:
One the first day, huge number of people have their birthdays - unusual
On the 31st, fewer number of people - makes sense because not all months have 31st

***

### Moira's Investigation
Notes:
Mismatch between perceived audience size for a post and actual audience (counted)
People underestimated their audience size - typically quarter of actual audience
In ggplot, she plotted a histogram of people's guesses for perceived audience
***


#### Think about a time when you posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What was it?
Response: Birthday post for a friend, 250 friends saw it, 50% of friends (500)

Notes:

### Faceting Friend Count
```{r Faceting Friend Count}
# What code would you add to create a facet the histogram by gender?
# Add it to the code below.
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))
