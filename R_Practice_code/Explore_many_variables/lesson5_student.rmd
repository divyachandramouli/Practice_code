Lesson 5
========================================================

### Multivariate Data
Two variables - scatterplot works
Third variable - add another way to represent it

***

### Moira Perceived Audience Size Colored by Age
Perceived audience size vs actual audience size
3rd var : age
Perceived audience size by age plot - add color to represent age
- again getting horizontal stripes - no pattern in color - overplotting 
Can't tell if older people guessed better than younger people
Sometimes it's a dead end

***

### Third Qualitative Variable
Examine relationship between friend count and age by adding a third variable

Without adding age as a variable:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(friend_count),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~gender)
```

Statistics for friedn_count by gender
```{r}
by(pf$friend_count,pf$gender,summary)
```
It appears that females have more friends on average than male users
Is this because female users have a different age distribution??
Maybe conditional on age, the differences are actually larger?

```{r Third Qualitative Variable}
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep='\t')
ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = age),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_boxplot()+
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = 'point', shape =4)
```
Averages are marked by an X
Since male users are a bit younger, we might think that a simple male female comparison doesn't capture the differences in friend count


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=age, y = friend_count),data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_line(aes(color=gender),stat='summary',fun.y=median)
```

Almost throughout median friend count for women is larger than for men, with exceptions - that include noisy estimates for very "old"" users- we are not confident about these ages reported
Users reporting to be 70 have the same friend count regardless of gender

ggplot(aes(x = tenure, y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure >= 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 7 * round(tenure / 7), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)
