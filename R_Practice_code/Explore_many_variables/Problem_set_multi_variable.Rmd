# Create a histogram of diamond prices. Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars. The plot should look something like this.

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type 'qual' was used to color the histogram using
# scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual').
# Note that the plot in the linked image is using log(price) for the x-axis to adjust for positive skew in the data.

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=price), data=diamonds)+
  facet_wrap(~color)+
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = diamonds$cut))
```

Adjusting for the positive skew in the data using x=log(price), see how the plot changes

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=log(price)), data=diamonds)+
  facet_wrap(~color)+
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = diamonds$cut))
```
Using the same colors as in the reference plot


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=log(price)), data=diamonds)+
  facet_wrap(~color)+
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = diamonds$cut))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')
```

# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs. table and color the points by the cut of
# the diamond. The plot should look something like this.
# http://i.imgur.com/rQF9jQr.jpg

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type 'qual' was used to color the scatterplot using
# scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual')

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=table, y=price), data=diamonds)+
  geom_point(aes(color = cut))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(50,80,2), limits=c(50,80))
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual')
```

# Typical table range for the majority of diamonds of 'ideal' cut and 'premium' cut - don't need to run summary for this 
By statistics can be answered by the table below

```{r}

by(diamonds$table,diamonds$cut,summary)
```
# But the question is for majority of diamonds, the table range
From the graph:
Ideal : 53 - 57
Premium : 58 - 62

# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs. volume (x * y * z) and color the points by
# the clarity of diamonds. Use scale on the y-axis to take the log10 of price. You should also
# omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.

# Note: Volume is a very rough approximation of  a diamond's actual volume.

# The plot should look something like this. http://i.imgur.com/excUpea.jpg

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type 'div' was used to color the scatterplot using
# scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')

### Creating a volume column using transform

```{r}
diamonds$volume=NA
diamonds=transform(diamonds, volume=x*y*z)
names(diamonds)
```

### Scatterplot of price vs volume colored by clarity

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=volume, y=price), data =diamonds)+geom_point(aes(color=clarity))+
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')+scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,500), breaks=seq(0,500,100))
  
```

# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

```{r}
names(pf)
```



```{r}
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep='\t')
pf$prop_initiated = pf$friendships_initiated/pf$friend_count
head(pf)

```
